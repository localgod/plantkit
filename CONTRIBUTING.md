## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment. Please be considerate and professional in all interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git**

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/plantkit.git
cd plantkit
```

1. Add the upstream repository:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/localgod/plantkit.git
```

## Development Environment

### Local Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

1. **Build the project:**

```bash
npm run build
```

1. **Run tests:**

```bash
npm test
```

### Using Gitpod (Recommended)

PlantKit includes a pre-configured development environment using Gitpod:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/localgod/plantkit)

The Gitpod environment includes:

- Node.js LTS
- All project dependencies
- Pre-configured dev container

## Development Workflow

### Available Scripts

- **`npm run build`** - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- **`npm run dev`** - Watch mode for development
- **`npm test`** - Run tests with Vitest
- **`npm run test:coverage`** - Run tests with coverage report
- **`npm run lint`** - Lint source code with ESLint
- **`npm run lint:fix`** - Auto-fix linting issues
- **`npm run mdlint`** - Lint markdown files

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch:**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Use descriptive branch names:

- `feature/add-new-element-type`
- `fix/diagram-rendering-bug`
- `docs/improve-api-documentation`

1. **Make your changes:**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow existing code style and patterns
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

1. **Test your changes:**

```bash
npm run lint
npm run mdlint
npm test
npm run build
```

1. **Commit your changes:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add support for new ArchiMate element type"
```

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow conventional commit format:

- **`feat:`** - New feature
- **`fix:`** - Bug fix
- **`docs:`** - Documentation changes
- **`test:`** - Adding or updating tests
- **`refactor:`** - Code refactoring
- **`chore:`** - Maintenance tasks
- **`style:`** - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)

Examples:

```typescript
feat: add support for ArchiMate 3.2 elements
fix: correct relationship direction in ElementGraph
docs: update API reference for Diagram class
test: add coverage for edge cases in PlantKit.toValidElementName
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use **TypeScript** for all source code
- Enable strict type checking
- Provide type definitions for all public APIs
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Style

- **Indentation:** 4 spaces (configured in project)
- **Quotes:** Single quotes for strings
- **Semicolons:** Not required (project uses ASI)
- **Line length:** Keep reasonable (ESLint configured)
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

### File Organization

```bash
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ archimate/          # ArchiMate-specific implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ Diagram.mts         # Diagram generation
â”œâ”€â”€ Element.mts         # Element tree structures
â”œâ”€â”€ ElementGraph.mts    # Relationship graphs
â”œâ”€â”€ PlantKit.mts        # Utility functions
â””â”€â”€ index.mts           # Public API exports

tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ *.test.mts          # Test files mirror src/ structure
```

### Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Document complex logic with inline comments
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Include examples for new features

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Use **Vitest** for testing
- Place tests in `tests/` directory
- Name test files: `*.test.mts`
- Follow existing test patterns

Example test structure:

```typescript
import { describe, expect, it, beforeEach } from 'vitest';
import { YourClass } from '../src/YourClass.mjs';

describe('YourClass', () => {
  let instance: YourClass;

  beforeEach(() => {
    instance = new YourClass();
  });

  it('should do something specific', () => {
    const result = instance.method();
    expect(result).toBe(expectedValue);
  });
});
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for high test coverage (current coverage visible in PRs)
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Include integration tests for complex features

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode during development
npm run dev  # In one terminal
npm test     # In another terminal
```
